# Tip-Calculator
This is a tip calculator.

It will ask you to enter the total bill amount.

Next it will ask you what is the percent tip youd like to give.

Finnally it would ask you how many people youd like to split the bill.

Then it would output the total each person should pay after the tip is included.

Feel free to try it out.
